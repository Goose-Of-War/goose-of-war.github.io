# Notes to Self:

### Why this file?
This file is more of a way of reminding me what I have learned while making this webpage and why some unexpected outputs were caused. 

##
### Notes:
- **\[CSS\] `margin` vs `padding`:** `margin` allocates some external space between the class in question and the parent class, while `padding` adds some space inside the class. `margin` operates outside, while `padding` operates inside.

Until later
