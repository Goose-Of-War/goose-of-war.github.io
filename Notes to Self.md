# Notes to Self:

### Why this file?
This file is more of a way of reminding me what I have learned while making this webpage and why some unexpected outputs were caused.

### Notes:
- **\[CSS\] `margin` vs `padding`:** `margin` allocates some external space between the class in question and the parent class, while `padding` adds some space inside the class. `margin` operates outside, while `padding` operates inside. 
- **Custom Tags:** It seems that I can make custom tags and give it some formatting. This feels slightly different from your usual class based styling. 
- **CSS**: It can be a superb pain in the head, especially if you mess the dimensions. Trial and error is needed till a satisfactory result is achieved.
- **\[CSS\]** `flex` containers: Really useful when it comes to organizing multiple elements inside a class.
- **\[CSS\]** `transitions`: They happen generally on the top-most object which the cursor can interact with among children classes. For a parent class, if it's in, it works.
- **\[CSS\]** `::before` and `::after`: Used to add some text, bullet or object before the span/div's text. They have a `content` property which allows them to the changed as per requirement.
