		~ A goose who's been through so much war that peace is now not an option at all; maybe it never was...
	</div>
	The goose bit seems a bit far-fetched, doesn't it? Well, that's what my character generally is. In reality, I'm just a guy in glasses who tries dumb stuff every now and then.<br>

	Honk to everyone here. I am Vidunram, but I often go by these aliases/nicknames/whatever you want to call them.
	<ul>
		<li>Shortened forms of my name, like Vidun, Vid, etc.</li>
		<li><strong>Goos</strong> (without an 'e'; <em>he lost it in the war</em>) </li>
		<li>Some abominations which are formed by butchering my name, intentionally or not.</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	
	<h2>What do I know?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><code>Python:</code> Learning since 2019, Python would be what I would consider my confort zone. Over the years, most of the things which I have done are in Python.</li>
		<li><code>C:</code> Thanks to the first-year programming course offered, I know a little bit about using C. <del>(Considering <strong>C++</strong> is just a badass extension of C, should I be including it in this list?)</del></li>
		<li><code>C#:</code> This is among the few in this list which I am mentioning because I have a bare minimum knowledge of it. I learnt this for using Unity, which, needless to say, I haven't touched in a while now.</li>
		<li><code>JavaScript:</code> I mean, it kind of makes sense considering Python is more back-end than front-end? Well, I haven't done squat using JS yet, so there's that.</li>
		<li><code>HTML|CSS:</code> As you could've guessed, I suck at this as of now. Let's just hope I improve soon.</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	
	<h2>What am I doing here?</h2>
	Well, I am sort of adding some elementary formatting to my HTML page file, while I fill most of my doc content before going fashionista with the styles. I'm low-key considering using blocks of text with a small title class inside a div class as an approach, but before that, I need to learn some more CSS. <br>
	I'll also probably add some of my GitHub repositories over here.

	The progress in this webpage is slowly increasing. Until then<br>
