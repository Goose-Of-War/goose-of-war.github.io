		Honk to everyone here. I am Vidunram, but you can call me <strong>'Goose'</strong> (or a shortened form of my name.) As I mentioned before, I'm just a guy in glasses who does some simple stuff in a computer, be it a Discord bot or a small game.

		This page is my way of learning to use HTML and CSS. I have not included any bit of JS or any other frameworks. Everything here is purely front-end. Also, this page sort of acts like a secondary intro page (after <a href="https://github.com/Goose-Of-War">my GitHub README</a>)
