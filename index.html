	The goose bit seems a bit far-fetched, doesn't it? Well, that's what my character generally is. In reality, I'm just a guy in glasses who tries dumb stuff every now and then.<br>

	Honk to everyone here. I am Vidunram, but I often go by these aliases/nicknames/whatever you want to call them.
	<ul>
		<li>Shortened forms of my name, like Vidun, Vid, etc.</li>
		<li><strong>Goos</strong> (without an 'e'; <em>he lost it in the war</em>) </li>
		<li>Some abominations which are formed by butchering my name, intentionally or not.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>What am I doing here?</h2>
	Well, I am sort of adding some elementary formatting to my HTML page file, while I fill most of my doc content before going fashionista with the styles. I'm low-key considering using blocks of text with a small title class inside a div class as an approach, but before that, I need to learn some more CSS. <br>
	I'll also probably add some of my GitHub repositories over here.
