## Introduction

Hello. Goose here, working on my first Web repository: A portfolio. This portfolio is my way of learning HTML and CSS while also learning to implement it in a website. A huge shoutout to [Ashwin Prasanth](https://github.com/ashwinpra) for giving me the idea to make a repository to learn this. 

In the repository, you might be able to see some 

#
### What have you done till now, Goose?
- (As a first step) listed all the content which I will be using in the [HTML file](index.html), mainly as text, (except for some instances where I have used CSS.)
- Used CSS to style some basic elements (mainly to differentiate different components of the webpage.)
- Used CSS to style a div and it's sub-classes which can be [found here](https://goose-of-war.github.io#languages-list). 

### What's coming in the future?
- Will add CSS styling for the other components of the portfolio as well
- Will change the colour scheme, because- let's face it- it sucks as of now.
- Might add some new content (though this one is a bit of a doubt.)

#
Until later, then.
