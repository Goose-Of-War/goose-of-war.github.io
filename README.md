## Introduction

Hello. Goose here, working on my first Web repository: A portfolio. This portfolio is my way of learning HTML and CSS while also learning to implement it in a website. A huge shoutout to [Ashwin Prasanth](https://github.com/ashwinpra) for giving me the idea to make a repository to learn this. 

In the repository, there are two HTML files (**index.html** for the main webpage and **playgrounds.html** for testing purposes), two CSS files (one for each HTML file) and some images (in the folder `/icons`).  

#
### So... What have you got for us, Goose?
For the most part, this repository contains only HTML and CSS. There are some animations, transitions, and some very elementary looking styling.

### And... is that it?
I hope not. After 4 months of working on WebD, I can say this with certainty (I mean, I kinda did even back when I was making this.) The styling sucks. Not an ounce fo responsiveness, absurd color scheme, and the sheer lack of stuff which I could do with JS but haven't done is racking my brain (yes, blame it on [Part](https://github.com/PartMan7) for getting me into WebD and [Mokshith](https://github.com/mokshith25) for being good at front-end)

I most certainly might be working on this repository (not as frequently as I want to) as this year (2022, if someone is reading this in, well, not 2022) comes to an end. Here's hoping for a new clean look as the new year comes.

Until later, then.

_For the most part, this repository was thought to be dead, but then again, the black magic brings the dead back to life (although it's not as lively as you want it to be)_
