## Introduction

Hello. This is Goose, working on the a portfolio website. Huge shoutout to [Ashwin Prasanth](https://github.com/ashwinpra) for recommending the idea. This portfolio will be a way for me to explore Web Development as I practice. 

For the first commit, I know it looks rather bleak, but until then, please be patient.

Honk.
