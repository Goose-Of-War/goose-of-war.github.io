## Introduction

Hello. This is Goose, working on the a portfolio website. Huge shoutout to [Ashwin Prasanth](https://github.com/ashwinpra) for recommending the idea. This portfolio will be a way for me to explore Web Development as I practice. 

##
Now... I know you have seen some updates in the website. I guess this will become a bit more well-defined as time goes on? Maybe. Until then, I request you to sit back and watch it as it goes. 

(I'll be a bit honest. This README file makes me wonder what I should even write here.)

:swan: Honk.
